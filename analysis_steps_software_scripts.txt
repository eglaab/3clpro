1.) Ligand collection, pre-processing and filtering

a) ZINC database:
Compounds were downloaded in SMILES-format, using the “ZINC-downloader-2D-
smi.wget” script derived from the “Tranches” web-page on ZINC 
(https://zinc.docking.org/tranches/home, version ZINC15, May 2020). The 
following filtering criteria were applied to all compounds available via the 
ZINC Tranches web-page: “drug-like”, “purchasable” (minimum purchasability = 
“Wait OK”) and reactivity = “clean”. This first-step filtering reduced the 
initial 1,276,766,435 substances to 898,838,573 retained substances. 

b) SWEETLEAD database:
All compounds from the SWEETLEAD database (version: 1.0) were downloaded in May 
2020 (https://simtk.org/projects/sweetlead).

c) MolPort database:
All compounds from the MolPort library were downloaded in May 2020
(https://www.molport.com/shop/database-download).

d) Ligand pre-processing:
Ligand preprocessing involved adding hydrogens and generating 3D structures, 
where not already provided in the source databases, while protonation states and 
partial charges were assigned during the docking stage. Specifically, the 
compounds were preprocessed using the AutoDock ligand preparation script 
(prepare_ligand4.py) from the MGLTools package (version 1.5.6, Linux, x64) with 
default parameters, and conformers were generated using the OpenEye OMEGA 
software (version: 3.1.2.2) using the classic mode with default parameters.

e) Ligand-based similarity screening / filtering:
Since the number of pre-selected compounds obtained from the ZINC database was 
too large for comprehensive docking analyses, this compound library was further 
filtered using a ligand-based similarity screening with the BioSolveIT Ftrees 
software (version 6.2). The topological and physicochemical similarity of the 
library compounds to known small-molecule inhibitors for SAR-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 
3CLpro reported in the literature was scored with this method, to filter the 
library down to the compounds most similar to known 3CLpro inhibitors. 
Specifically, the literature-derived query compounds include the reported SARS-
CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors GC-376, ebselen and baicalein, and the reported SARS-CoV 
3CLpro inhibitors amentoflavone, hesperetine, pectolinarin and dieckol. 
Moreover, to further extend the search space of potential candidate inhibitor 
compounds, four additional query compounds for the feature tree search were 
included by adding the top-ranked compounds from the initial AutoDock-GPU 
screening on the SWEETLEAD database. All compounds from the ZINC library 
exceeding a minimum similarity threshold of 0.8 in the FTrees screen to these 
query compounds were retained for the subsequent molecular docking analyses (see 
script "ftrees_screening.R" on the GitHub web-page https://github.com/eglaab).


2.) Protein structure selection, pre-processing and quality control

a) Protein structure selection:
Three publicly available protein crystal structures for 3CLPro from the Protein 
Data Bank (PDB) were chosen for the molecular docking analyses and binding 
affinity estimation: 5R8T, 6YB7 and 6LU7. The structures 5R8T and 6YB7 were 
selected mainly due to their resolution (5R8T: 1.27 Å, 6YB7: 1.25 Å) and quality 
(R-free value: 0.208 for 5R8T and 0.192 for 6YB7), see additional quality 
assessments described below), whereas the structure 6LU7 was used additionally 
as a representation of the holo form of the protein in complex with an inhibitor 
(resolution: 2.16 Å, R-free value: 0.235), allowing us to compare docking 
results across different types of structures.

b) Protein structure pre-processing:
The receptor structures were pre-processed using the Schrödinger Maestro 
software (version 11.8.0.1.2, www.schrodinger.com) by adding hydrogens, 
generating protonation states, and optimizing hydrogen positions using the 
‘Protein Preparation Wizard’ with default settings. 

c) Protein structure quality control:
The quality of the original and processed structures was assessed using the 
software tools Verify3D, WHATCHECK and PROCHECK as implemented in the software 
SAVES 5.0 (http://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES), confirming the suitability of 
the structures for docking simulations in terms of common quality control checks 
[37]. For structure files containing multiple chains, the chain with the highest 
Verify3D score was chosen for further analysis.


3.) Virtual screening

a) Docking using AutoDock-GPU:
The pre-selected compound libraries were docked using AutoDock-GPU (version: 
OpenCL and Cuda accelerated version of AutoDock4.2.6, Linux, x64, 
autodock_gpu_256wi) with the parameter ‘nrun’ for the thoroughness of the search 
space exploration set to 100, and default parameters otherwise (see script 
"autodock_screening.R" on the GitHub web-page https://github.com/eglaab).

b) Docking using OpenEye HYBRID:
The pre-selected compound libraries were docked using OpenEye HYBRID with 
default docking parameters (see script "openeye_hybrid_docking.sh" on the GitHub 
web-page https://github.com/eglaab).

c) Docking using LeadIT/FlexX + binding affinity estimation with LeadIT/HYBRID:
Only compounds with higher than average docking scores derived from the 
AutoDock-GPU and OpenEye HYBRID screenings were also docked using a more time-
consuming combined docking and binding affinity estimation approach, by applying 
the software LeadIT/FlexX (version 2019.Nov.2-Ubuntu-18.04-x64) with default 
docking parameters and a subsequent estimation of the binding affinity for the 
top 30 docking poses using the LeadIT/HYDE approach (version: 3.2.5).

d) Ranking and selection:
After obtaining the docking scores for each of the three docking approaches, the 
list of compounds docked with each method was ranked and sorted according to the 
sum of ranks across the scores for all methods. Only top-ranked compounds 
achieving consistently high docking scores for the three pre-processed 3CLpro 
protein structures (PDB: 5R8T, 6YB7 and 6LU7) were used for experimental 
validation. 

e) Alternative screening approaches:
For the MolPort compound library, we tested multiple alternative more extensive 
screening approaches without prior library filtering: (1) a screening approach 
relying purely on fast molecular docking approaches (see sections 3 a), b) and 
c)), (2) a screening approach relying purely on machine learning (see section 3 
f) below), and (3) a combination of molecular docking and ligand-similarity 
based screening using the software FTrees (following the same approach as for 
the ZINC database described in section 1 e), but without prior database 
filtering, and focusing on the most potent available 3CLPro inhibitor, GC-376, 
as query compound). This extended analysis was limited to the MolPort compounds, 
because this library was our main resource for commercially available compounds 
and therefore of particular practical relevance for the experimental studies, 
and due to its smaller size (~7.7 million compounds), an extension to further 
screening approaches was still feasible in terms of runtime requirements.

f) Machine learning based screening:
To assess a 3CLpro candidate inhibitor ranking approach using machine learning 
and extend the selection of compounds for experimental testing, molecular 
descriptors were computed for the compounds, as implemented in the R software 
package “rcdk” (version 3.5.0) using SMILES compound representations as input. 
For the training of the machine learning model, a published training set 
collection of small molecules containing both previously reported SARS-CoV or 
SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro inhibitors (486 compounds, used as positive set) and compounds 
reported not to bind to 3CLPro (700 compounds, used as negative set) was used to 
compute the moleclular descriptors (Ivanov et al., ACS Omega, 2020). On this 
training data of descriptors for the positive and negative compound sets, a 
classification model was trained using the Random Forest algorithm as 
implemented in the R software package “randomForest” (version 4.6-14) with 250 
decision trees and default parameters otherwise. This trained model was used to 
rank all compounds in the MolPort library, by computing the molecular 
descriptors with the “rcdk” package and applying the trained model to estimate 
the probabiliy of belonging to the active inhibitors (see script 
"ml_screening.R" on the GitHub web-page https://github.com/eglaab).


4.) Molecular Dynamics simulations
The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the ligand binding stability 
for the top-ranked compounds obtained from docking simulations in the 3CLpro 
binding pocket were performed using a GPU-accelerated version of the software 
NAMD (Git-2020-07-30 for Linux-x86 64-multicore-CUDA). All non-default 
configuration settings used for the simulations are specified in the file 
"ligand_binding_simulation.namd" available on the GitHub web-page 
(https://github.com/eglaab). Briefly, the step size was 2 fs, and the simulation 
was performed for a duration of 20 ns, the topology and force field parameters 
for the MD simulations were assigned from the CHARMM36 protein lipid parameter 
set for the receptor, and from the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) parameter 
set for the ligands. Video animations of the simulations were created by 
applying the “MD Movie” function in the software Chimera (version 1.12, build 
41623, [51]) to the trajectory data for the protein-ligand complexes derived 
from NAMD.
